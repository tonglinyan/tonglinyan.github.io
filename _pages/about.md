I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams), [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), supervised by [David Rudrauf](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/drproj/) (CIAMS, Université Paris-Saclay), [Alain Finkel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=jq7H21IAAAAJ&hl=fr) (LMF, ENS Paris-Sacaly), and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](http://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/index.html) (LCQB, Sorbonne Université).

I hold an Engineering Degree in Mathematical and Software Engineering from INSA Rouen Normandie and a Master’s in Data Science and Engineering (SID), co-accredited by INSA Rouen and the University of Rouen Normandy. -->

### Research Interests

My research explores the integration of computational models of consciousness, particularly the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), with advanced machine learning approaches such as LLMs and MLLMs to investigate human-like intelligence in virtual agents. I focus on exploring methods that can integrate multimodal data (facial expressions, gaze, movement, and language) in world space to generate coherent verbal and nonverbal behavior in immersive virtual reality. I am also interested in computational models of consciousness as a scientific framework for understanding human consciousness, with a particular emphasis on linking computational theory and implementable simulations. My broader goal is to evaluate LLMs within social cognitive science, advancing the decision-making of virtual agents in social cognitive scenarios.
