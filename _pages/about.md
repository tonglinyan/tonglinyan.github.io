I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams), [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), supervised by [David Rudrauf](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/drproj/) (CIAMS, Université Paris-Saclay), [Alain Finkel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=jq7H21IAAAAJ&hl=fr) (LMF, ENS Paris-Sacaly), and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](http://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/index.html) (LCQB, Sorbonne Université).

I hold an Engineering Degree in Mathematical and Software Engineering from INSA Rouen Normandie and a Master’s in Data Science and Engineering (SID), co-accredited by INSA Rouen and the University of Rouen Normandy. -->

### Research Interests

My research investigates human-like intelligence in virtual agents by integrating computational models of consciousness, such as the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), with large-scale models (LLMs/MLLMs). The core of my work focuses on developing methods that fuse multimodal data (including facial expressions, gaze, movement, and language) within a unified world space to generate coherent verbal and nonverbal behavior in immersive virtual reality. I am also interested in computational models of consciousness as a scientific framework for understanding human consciousness, with a particular emphasis on linking computational theory and implementable simulations. A broader research interest lies in the evaluation of LLMs within social cognitive science, identifying specific limitations in their social reasoning, thereby advancing the development of decision-making models for virtual agents.
