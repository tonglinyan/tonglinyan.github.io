I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the joint supervision of [David Rudrauf](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/drproj/), [Alain Finkel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=jq7H21IAAAAJ&hl=fr) (ENS Paris-Sacaly), and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](http://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/index.html) (Sorbonne Université).

I hold an Engineering Degree in Mathematical Engineering from INSA Rouen Normandie and a Master’s in Data Science & Engineering (SID), jointly accredited by INSA Rouen and the University of Rouen Normandy.

Research Focus

My work explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Projective Consciousness Model (PCM), aiming to advance computational frameworks for studying consciousness. I also investigate mathematical modeling of consciousness, bridging cognitive science, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory.
