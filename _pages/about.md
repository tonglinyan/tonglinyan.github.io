I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the laboratory [CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). My Ph.D. program is conducted under the joint supervision of [David Rudrauf](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/drproj/) from Université Paris-Sacaly, [Alain Finkel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=jq7H21IAAAAJ&hl=fr) from [ENS Paris-Sacaly](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](http://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/index.html) from [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). 

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandie with an Engineering Degree in Mathematics Engineering. I also pursued a double master's degree in Data Science and Engineering (SID), co-accredited by INSA Rouen Normandie and Université de Rouen Normandie.

My research interest focuses on integrating Large Language Model into Projective Consicousness Model. I'm also interested in the mathematical model of consciousness.
