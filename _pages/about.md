I'm a first-year phd student from [laboratory CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams), [Paris Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). My research interest focuses on the intersection of cognition science and artificial intelligence. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) from Paris-Saclay University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
