I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the laboratory [CIAMS](https://www.faculte-sciences-sport.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/presentation-unite-de-recherche-ciams) at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). My Ph.D. program is conducted under the joint supervision of David Rudrauf from Université Paris-Sacaly, [Alain Finkel](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=jq7H21IAAAAJ&hl=fr) from [ENS Paris-Sacaly](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](http://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/index.html) from [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). 

I graduated from [INSA Rouen Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/) with an Engineering Degree in Mathematics Engineering. I also pursued a double master's degree in Data Science and Engineering (SID), co-accredited by INSA Rouen Normandie and [Université de Rouen Normandie](https://www.univ-rouen.fr/).

My research interest focuses on the intersection of cognition science and artificial intelligence.
